 wignerdmat_mem: given a wigner little-d matrix of degree L-1 evaluated
             at some angle beta, construct the wigner little-d
             matrix of degree L, EVALUATED AT THAT SAME BETA.

 arguments:

         INPUT:

         L: degree of wigner little-d's that you want

         matIn: array of doubles of length (2*L-1)*(2*L-1), containing
                the values of d_{m1,m2}^(L-1)(beta) for
                -(L-1) <= m1, m2 <= L-1

                So matIn contains the Wigner litte-d's for the
                PREVIOUS degree, L - 1.

         trigs: array of doubleS of length 2, containing, IN THIS ORDER,
                cos(beta/2) and sin(beta/2)

         sqrts: array of doubleS of length >= L+1. It contains the square roots
                of 0 through L+1

         workspace: scratch array of doubleS of size (2*L)^2


         OUTPUT:

         matOut: array of doubleS of length (2*L+1)*(2*L+1), will contain
                 the values of d_{m1,m2}^(L)(beta) for
                 -(L+1) <= m1, m2 <= (L+1)


         The 1-d matIn/matOut arrays are in ROW-MAJOR format, with m1 indexing the
         rows, and m2 indexing the columns of the 2-D matrix. The indexing
         goes from -L to L top to bottom/left to right. E.g. For the
         case of L = 1, the 2-d array is

         ( d_{-1,-1}^1   d_{-1,0}^1   d_{-1,1}^1 )
         (                                       )
         ( d_{ 0,-1}^1   d_{ 0,0}^1   d_{ 0,1}^1 )
         (                                       )
         ( d_{ 1,-1}^1   d_{ 1,0}^1   d_{ 1,1}^1 )

         and it's stored in the 1-d array in this manner:

         ( d_{-1,-1}^1   d_{-1,0}^1 ... d_{ 1,0}^1  d_{ 1,1}^1 )


 NOTE: 1) These wigner little-ds are NOT normalized! They will be used only
          for rotations.

       2) If L = 0 or 1, then matIn can be any ol' array (since it isn't used
          in this case). The array matOut will be what you want. The L = 0 and 1
          arrays are constructed by hand.

       3) This algorithm is a slight variation of the one given by T. Risbo in

          "Fourier transform summation of Legendre series and D-Functions"
          T. Risbo

		    and three Euler angles alpha, beta, gamma, multiply

		    In other words, I'm rotating f by the Euler angles,
		    and I'm massaging the coefficients as representation
		    theory says I should.
		    
  Arguments:

	L: degree of coefficients (i.e. the representation)

	cfR, cfI: two 1-D double arrays, each of length 2L+1,
	      containing the real and imaginary parts of
	      the coefficients of the signal to be rotated.
	      Each is in the following order:

	      [ f_L^(-L) f_L^(-L+1) ... f_L^(-1) 0 f_L^(1) ... f_L^(L) ]

	expAR, expAI: two 1-D double arrays, each of length at least
	        2L+1, containing the real and imaginary parts of the
		following array in the following order:

		[exp(-I*alpha*(-M)) ... exp(-I*alpha*M)] 

		where M >= L.

		I saw "at least" because, since all the coefficients
		will be massaged, of all degrees, you might as well
		precompute all the numbers you'll possibly need:

		[exp(-I*alpha*(-(bw-1))) ... exp(-I*alpha*(bw-1))]
		
		at the start, and be done with it ... no need to compute
		the same stuff again and again, for each L

	expGR, expGI: two 1-D double arrays, each of length at least
	        2L+1, containing the real and imaginary parts of the
		following array in the following order:

		[exp(-I*gamma*(-M)) ... exp(-I*gamma*M)] 

		where M >= L.

		See the explanation for expA. It's the same case here.

        expZero -> WHERE in expA, expG does the 0 term, i.e. exp(-I*0),
                occur? I need to know where to start, especially since
		expA, expG might be arrays longer then I need for the
		particular degree L this routine is given.


	dmat -> double array of length (2*L+1)^2: it contains the
	        "beta" array generated by wignerdmat, i.e. the array
		you get when plugging beta into that routine.

	OUTPUT:

	cfrR, cfrI: two 1-D double arrays, each of length 2*L+1,
	       containing the real and imaginary parts of the
	       degree L coefficients of the rotated function



  Basically, this routine does a matrix-vector multiply, where the
  matrix is [Wigner-D_{M,M'}(alpha,beta,gamma)] of dimension (2L+1)x(2L+1),
  and the vector is the vector of spherical coefficients f_l^m. To
  be a little more precise ... the rows are indexed by the order M,
  and the columns by M', where -L <= M, M' <= L. E.g.

  [ D_{-1,-1}  D_{-1,0}  D_{-1,1} ]   [ f_1^{-1} ]
  [                               ]   [          ]
  [ D_{ 0,-1}  D_{ 0,0}  D_{ 0,1} ] . [ f_1^{ 0} ]
  [                               ]   [          ]
  [ D_{ 1,-1}  D_{ 1,0}  D_{ 1,1} ]   [ f_1^{ 1} ]

  NOTE that these Wigner-D's are not normalized like they are when doing
  the forward/inverse SO(3) transform!

		 of that function.

		 More plainly, let g be an element of SO(3). We can
		 write it in terms of the Euler angles alpha, beta,
		 and gamma, where alpha and gamma are the angles of
		 rotation about the z-axis, and beta is rotation
		 about the y-aixs. So, given a bandlimited function
		 f defined on the sphere, we can rotate it:

		 f(omega) -> \Lambda(g)f(omega) = f(g^(-1) omega).

		 What rotateCoefAll does is massage all the coefficients
		 of f in such a way as to get coefficients of
		 \Lambda(g)f(omega). Representation theory says
		 we can, and so we will.

		 NOTE: Here are order of rotation events:
		       1) rotate by gamma about the z-axis
		       2) rotate by beta about the y-axis
		       3) rotate by alpha about the z-axis.
		 

		 NOTE: This routine will WRITE OVER the input

	           all the degrees 0 <= L < bw, for whatever
		   reason you may want to go only "so far" and
		   rotate only through L = degOut. The rotated
		   coefficients for degrees degOut+1 <= L < bwIn
		   will be set to 0.

	   alpha, beta, gamma: the Euler angles

	   cfR, cfI: two double arrays containing the real and imaginary
	          parts of the spherical coefficients of f BEFORE AND

	the use of the indexing functions
	
	seanindex
	seanindex2
	
	defined in primitive_FST.[c,h].

  NOTE: Since the routines in SpharmonicKit produce two separate double
